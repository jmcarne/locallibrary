## settings.py contains all the website settings. This is where we register any applications we create, the location of our static files, database configuration details, etc.  

# urls.py defines the site url-to-view mappings. While this could contain all the url mapping code, it is more common to delegate some of the mapping to particular applications, as you'll see later.

# wsgi.py used to help your Django application communicate with the web server. You can treat this as boilerplate.

# manage.py used to create applications, work with databases and start the development web server
